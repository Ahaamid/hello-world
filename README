# hello-world
My name is Ahmad, this my first repository

For a while, I didn't know much about web development, or programming in general, but thanks to NYCDA
I've found new skills in many programming languages: Javascript, SQL, CSS, etc.
I hope to one day find a job in tech-development that'll allow me create and help in the design of 
websites and applications.
